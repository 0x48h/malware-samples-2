## Training PCAPs

Sometimes you just a need to analyze some network traffic that exhibits specific characteristics - these PCAPs are intended for just that. Capture filters are applied as appropriate to limit the scope of the network traffic and are implied by the port description with each capture. Please note that some of these PCAPs may include traffic from malicious sources, such as the download of malicious files, so handle accordingly.
