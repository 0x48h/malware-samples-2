## Maldocs

Will contain Office documents identified to be used to distribute malware based on organizing folder structure. For example, the *emotet* folder will contain maldocs identified to have dropped Emotet. These samples are organized by year/month that I obtained and executed them - this may deviate slightly from when they were first discovered in the wild (for example, first submission date on VirusTotal).

To the max extend possible I will also include associated PCAPs. PCAPs may contain the resuling Emotet binary that was dropped, as well as follow-on C2 communication. However, I can not guarantee that each PCAP will contain this full sequence of events.

Current maldocs include:

* AgentTesla
* Banload
* Emotet
* Hancitor
* IcedId
* Lokibot
* Trickbot
* Unknown

## Memory Dumps

Will contain full VM memory and individual process memory dumps from malware samples. Most will come from dumpming memory via Cuckoo Sandox. Due to the size of the memory dumps, links to an archived version of them are provided for download. Current memory dumps include:

* Emotet
* LokiBot

## Binaries

This will contain binaries (i.e. PE/.NET, Java, etc) from known malware families. Currently, this archive contains samples from:

* Agenttesla
* Ave Maria / Warzone RAT
* Azorult
* Blue Botnet
* Buer Loader
* Dridex
* Emotet
* Gandcrab
* Lokibot
* Nanocore
* Remcos
* Socelars
* Trickbot
* Troldesh
* Turkojan
* Vidar
